Student Risk Prediction System
An end-to-end machine learning application that predicts whether a student is at academic risk based on key behavioral indicators.  
The project covers data preprocessing, model training, API development, UI integration, and cloud deployment.

Features
- Data cleaning and feature engineering pipeline
- Supervised ML model (Random Forest) trained on student performance data
- REST API built with FastAPI for real-time inference
- Interactive UI built with Streamlit
- Deployed using Render (backend + frontend)
- Reproducible project structure and model persistence

 Problem Statement
Educational institutions often need early warning systems to identify students at risk of poor academic performance.  
This project predicts risk using minimal yet meaningful features to enable fast, interpretable, and deployable predictions.
